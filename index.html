          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Income</h2>
          <p>Ordinarily poverty has been a contributor to disease and lifespan, but several recent trends have suggested that income and access to healthcare are not as strongly correlated as they may have been in years past.
            Income gaps have narrowed, states have instituted forms of subsidized health insurance, etc. and now more than ever, people have wider access to quality healthcare regardless of their income level.
            Looking at the scatter plot of the data, at first glance one could see a smallish positive correlation between these two factors.  As poverty rises, those lacking access to healthcare seems to also rise.
            But, in certain areas like District of Columbia, Ohio, and Michigan to name a few, there is a fairly large percentage of those in poverty yet these people still have access to healthcare.
            In sum, today there is a weak positive correlation between poverty and access to healthcare.  Given these recent trends, one could expect that correlation to even further decrease as time goes on.
